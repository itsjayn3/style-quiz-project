# Style Quiz!

A fun, responsive, and interactive web app that gives users a personalised style persona based on their answers to a visually-driven quiz. Built completely from scratch with **React** and **Vite** as part of my learning journey.

## ‚ú® Motivation  

I built this project to get hands-on with **React**. The goal wasn‚Äôt to create the most complex quiz in the world ‚Äî it‚Äôs deliberately simple, playful, and light-hearted ‚Äî but every feature was a chance for me to practice React concepts.  

What surprised me most was how much I learnt outside my original plan: expanding my **CSS knowledge**, experimenting with **timers**, and playing around with **blinking/animation effects**. The MVP came together in about 4 days, and while there are features I‚Äôd still like to add (restart button, more visuals for results, or even a cute personality description to make results more immersive), I‚Äôm proud of how polished it feels as a first React project.
